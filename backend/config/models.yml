# Model Configuration
#
# This project now uses a multi-file configuration system.
# Model configurations are split across the following files:
#
#   settings.yml           - Global settings (default models)
#   upscalers.yml          - Upscaler configurations
#   models-qwen-cli.yml    - Qwen Image (CLI mode)
#   models-qwen-image.yml  - Qwen Image (Server mode)
#   models-qwen-edit.yml   - Qwen Image Edit variants
#   models-z-turbo.yml     - Z-Image Turbo
#   models-copax.yml       - Copax Timeless XL+Z1
#   models-flux.yml        - Flux models
#   models-sd.yml          - Stable Diffusion models
#   models-api.yml         - External API mode models
#
# Config files are loaded in order by the modelManager.
# Later configs override earlier ones for any duplicate keys.

# For backward compatibility, you can still define models here.
# However, it's recommended to use the separate config files above.
